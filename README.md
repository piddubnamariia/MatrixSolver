## Overview
The goal was to implement an efficient matrix solver capable of finding the determinant of a matrix as well as its inverse. I developed a console application that can be run in a console or an integrated development environment such as VS Code. Users can input matrices, solve them, and perform file handling.

## Features
- **Matrix-solving algorithms**: Supports finding the determinant of a matrix in several ways depending on its size..
- **Matrix input**: Users can enter arrays manually, generate random arrays with specified size and range, and load a matrix from a text file.
- **Save results**: Ability to save the calculation results in a text file.

# Getting Started

## Requirements

- **VS Code**: Follow the instructions on the [VS Code website](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) to install VS Code.

## Setup and Running

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/piddubnamariia/MatrixSolver.git
cd MatrixSolver
```

### Step 2: Run MatrixSolver:
1. Start VS Code.
2. open Remote Explorer.
3. Create a codespace and select the MatrixSolver repository.
